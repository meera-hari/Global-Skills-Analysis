# Global-Skills-Analysis -Creating a dashboard on the insights of the Global skill level across the globe.
-A dataset from Coursera highlighting the Global Skills across countries has been collected by an edtech firm and they need the visual insights about the data and a clear idea of various skills that need to be focussed on in each country available in the dataset  
-The original dataset is available in excel format  
-The dataset has been loaded in to Power BI, where it is checked for null values and outliers with the help of Column Quality option  
-The data has then been further analyzed with the help of various charts and cards to get a clear understanding of the dataset  
Thank You!
